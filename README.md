# UDACITY Data Analysis Nanodegree Project: investigating a dataset "No-Show Medical Appointments"
Second Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project. This project investigates a medical appointments Dataset.

# Introduction
The objective of this project is to choose a data set from the options offered by Udacity to toanalyze it in order to communicate the findings.

# Project Overview
In this project I investigate the No-show appointments dataset, which collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

Project Table of Contents:
1. Introduction
2. Data Wrangling
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Conclusions
5. Limitations

# Why this Project?
In this project, I learned how to use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

# What did I learn?

 - Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
 - How to be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
 - How to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
 - Gained experience communicating the results of your analysis
 - How to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
 - Get familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
 - How to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
